Windows 95 Beer: A lot of people have taste-tested it and claim it's 
wonderful. The can looks a lot like Mac Beer's can, but tastes more like 
Windows 3.1 Beer. It comes in 32-oz.  cans, but when you look inside, the 
cans only have 16 oz. of beer in them. Most people will probably keep 
drinking Windows 3.1 Beer until their friends try Windows 95 Beer and say 
they like it. The ingredients list, when you look at the small print, has 
some of the same ingredients that come in DOS beer, even though the 
manufacturer claims that this is an entirely new brew.
